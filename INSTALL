Installing sakura
===============

* How to compile and install this beast ?

	$ cmake . 
	$ make
	$ su -c 'make install'

	sakura now use the CMake building system. Welcome to an autotools
	free world!! (Yes, sakura used MOBS before this, but what the hell,
	i wanted to say out loud that ;-))

	To install sakura with a different prefix, cmake needs to be
	invoked with the proper environment variables, so to install
	sakura in /usr, you should do:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

	Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug or CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release if you
	wish to select the build type. Default is Release.


Keybindings support
===================

    sakura supports keyboard bindings. They are configurable by
    setting the following properties in your sakura config file
    (~/.config/sakura/sakura.conf):

    Accelerators:

        Accelerators can be set to any mask value from the
        GdkModifierType in gdktypes.h. For reference look at:
            /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h

        Mask values can be combined by ORing them.

        For example, to set the delete tab accelerator to Ctrl + Shift:
            del_tab_accelerator=5
        because GDK_SHIFT_MASK has a value of 1 (1 << 0), and
        GDK_CONTROL_MASK has a value of 4 (1 << 2); ORing them
        together, you get 5.

        I realise that this configuration is not so friendly to
        non-programmers, but it is a start. :)

    Keys:

        For example, to set the add tab key to 'T':
            add_tab_key=T

		Before sakura used keycodes instead of strings. They're still valid.	


	Defaults:	

	Ctrl + Shift + T                 -> New tab
	Ctrl + Shift + W                 -> Close current tab
	Ctrl + Shift + C                 -> Copy selected text
	Ctrl + Shift + V                 -> Paste selected text
	Ctrl + Shift + N                 -> Set tab name
	Alt  + Left cursor               -> Previous tab
	Alt  + Right cursor              -> Next tab
	Ctr  + Shift + Left cursor       -> Move tab to the left
	Ctr  + Shift + Right cursor      -> Move tab to the right
	Alt  + [1-9]                     -> Switch to tab N (1-9)
	Ctrl + Shift + S                 -> Toggle/Untoggle scrollbar
	Ctrl + Shift + Mouse left button -> Open link
	F11                              -> Fullscreen
	Shift + PageUp                   -> Move up through scrollback by page
	Shift + PageDown                 -> Move down through scrollback by page
	Ctrl + Shift + Up                -> Move up through scrollback by line
	Ctrl + Shift + Down              -> Move down through scrollback by line
	Ctrl + Shift + [F1-F6]           -> Select the colorset for the current tab

	You can also increase and decrease the font size in the GTK+ 
	standard way (not configurable):
 
	Ctrl + '+'                                -> Increase font size
	Ctrl + '-'                                -> Decrease font size

Enjoy sakura !
